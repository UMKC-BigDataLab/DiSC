# DiSC

DiSC is a system for fast approximate score computation for learning multinomial Bayesian networks on large-scale distributed data. It employs decentralized computation using gossip algorithms, hashing techniques for load balancing, and a probabilistic approach for lowering resource consumption during score computation. DiSC significantly outperforms MapReduce-style computation for computing scores, which is a fundamental task during Bayesian structure learning.
